# Bank-Account-AVL-Tree
This program simulates a banking database using an avl tree structure. An Avl tree is a tree data structure that is self balancing. This means that no leaf node in the tree can be more than one level above or below any other leaf node. The tree is ordered by account numbers. This program allows accounts to be created, delete, and searched for in an avl tree.
